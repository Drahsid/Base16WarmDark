## Base16WarmDark Theme
VSTheme project using colors based on Base16 Grayscale Dark with a warm twist.
The theme is currently focused on C and C++, and thus may appear incorrect when using other languages (there are a lot of colors to try to correctly configure!)

I made this theme because I like the theme from which this is derived, and it does not exist (as far as I could find) for Visual Studio. I added the warm-twist because warm colors reduce eyestrain for me when I am in a poorly-lit environment.
